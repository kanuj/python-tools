## Introduction

These scripts are created for optimizing the mundane tasks that you and I do each day. 

## branches.py

Need to update your out-of-date branches every morning when you start work? Use this handy little python script instead. The script utilizes linux's notification to display the number of updated branches.

Protip: The script contains the path to the python env so just copy it to your /usr/local/bin for best results.

## checkout.list.py

Want to checkout an older branch but forgot what you named it? Just pass the term you remember faintly to this script and it'll return all the branches it finds matching your search term. To switch to any of the found branches just call the script again with the green number/index next to the branch and this script will set that branch as your working branch.
